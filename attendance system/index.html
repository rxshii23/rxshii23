    <p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Every organization should have an Attendance Management
      System for employees. Your system needs to comply with the Fair Labor Standards Act timekeeping requirements,
      regardless of how you implement it.

      Attendance Management Systems allow you to calculate the hours for which employees work accurately. This is
      especially beneficial if you have employees working on an hourly basis. You need to be able to calculate the exact
      wages you owe to your employees. And, you need to know if you owe overtime wages to any employees.

      If you have salaried employees, you can always see how often employees are working. Employees can record and
      document the time both at and away from your business. You can keep a track of how much they are working, even
      when you donâ€™t see them.

      Tracking employee time will also let you know if employees are punctual. This only works if you require employees
      to document the exact time they enter or leave. You can see if an employee tends to show up late or skip out early
      from work.

      Attendance management also lets you keep track of how many days off employees use. This is crucial if your
      business has a policy that lets employees use a certain number of sick or vacation days.
